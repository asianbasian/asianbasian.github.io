    <title> Barry's Wild Train Trip</title>
    </head>
<body>
    <h1> On this path you have decided to take Barry on a trip to help spice up his dull life </h1>
    <p1> Barry Deciding to have some enjoyment in his life got on the train going the other direction away from the dull known and into the surprising unknown of what lies ahead of him. On the train a bunch of street performers borded the train and began performing playing music and doing crazy acrobatic dance moves all across the train singing on the poles that are meant for people to hold onto to not fall.</p1>
    <p2> Barry not knowing what to do just stood there watching partaking in the impromptu dance routines, wondering if whether or not he should join in. He inevitably decides not to, believeing he would disturb them and all the other commuters who are enjoying the show.</p2>
